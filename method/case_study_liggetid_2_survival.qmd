> This analysis is in preparation for interviews related to time-to-event analysis. Focus will be put on the procedure (and how to do it in R), as well as interpretation of the results.

The data `liggetid` was collected at the Geriatric Department at Ullev√•l Sykehus. Detailed description can be found in [part 1](case_study_liggetid_1.qmd) of the case study. 

We will focus on the following variables: 

- `admission_year`, year of hospital admission
- `age`
- `sex`
- `admission_from`, where 1 = home, 2 = Div. of Medicine, 3 =
Div. of Surgery, 4 = Other division, 5 = Other hospital, 6 =
Nursing home
- `stroke`, where 1 = yes, 0 = no
- `los`, hospital stay, in days
