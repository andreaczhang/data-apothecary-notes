Code: [What If. R code](https://remlapmot.github.io/cibookex-r/)

Causal question: estimate the average causal effect of **smoking cessation** (treatment, A) on **weight gain** (outcome, Y)

Dataset: NHEFS. 1566 smokers, age 25-74. Baseline visit and follow-up 10 years later. A=1 means they quit smoking, 0 otherwise. Outcome weight gain measured in kg.

Adjust for 9 variables measured at baseline: 

* sex (0M 1F)
* age
* race (0 white 1 other)
* education (5 categories)
* intensity of smoking (n cigarettes per day)
* duration of smoking (years)
* physical activity in daily life (3 categories)
* recreational exercise (3 categories)
* weight (kg)



## IP weighting

IP weighting creates pseudo-population to remove covariates L to the treatment A. Properties of the pseudo-population: 

* A and L are statistically independent
* $E_{ps}[Y|A=a]$ equals the standardized mean in the actual population, $\sum_{l}E[Y|A=a,L=l]P[L=l]$.

Individual-specific IP weights for treatment A is $W = 1/f(A|L)$. For the quitters (A=1), $f(A|L) = P[A=1|L]$. This is also the **propensity score**.

The weights can be estimated non-parametrically when the problem is simple: count the number of people treated (A=1) in each stratum (L=1, L=0) and then divide by the number in the stratum. When the problem has more variables (confounders), fit a logistic regression to estimate the probability.
