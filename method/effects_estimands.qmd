## Effects

$Y^{a=1}, Y^{a=0}$ are the **potential outcomes** under treatment 1 and 0. They are random variables. Treatment A has causal effect if $Y^{a=1} \neq Y^{a=0}$.

For individual $i$, $Y_i^{a=1}, Y_i^{a=0}$ are deterministic. 

In reality we *do not* observe both potential outcomes for an individual, since we only have ONE outcome. We observe $Y$ and $A$. For a population, average treatment effect (ATE) can be estimate




## Estimands

Greifer, N., & Stuart, E. A. (2021). Choosing the estimand when matching or weighting in observational studies. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.10577.

ATE: average treatment effect in the population

$E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$

ATT: average treatment effect among the treated

$E[Y(1) - Y(0) | Z = 1]$

ATC: average treatment effect among the controls

$E[Y(1) - Y(0) | Z = 0]$

ATM: average treatment effect among the matched



## Graphical representation

| Data generation | Correct causal model | Correct causal effect |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
|      Collider   |    Y ~ X        |        1           |
|      Confounder |    Y ~ X; Z     |        0.5         |
|      Mediator   |   Direct effect: Y ~ X; Z. Total effect: Y ~ X     |  Direct: 0; total: 1  |
|      M-Bias     |    Y ~ X        |        1           |




## Selection bias

This bias is the result of selecting a common effect of 2 other variables (collider): a treatment, an outcome.

* non-response, missing data
* self-selection, volunteer bias
* selection affected by treatment before study started

A form of **lack of exchangeability** between the treated and untreated.

Correct for selection bias: IP weighting
