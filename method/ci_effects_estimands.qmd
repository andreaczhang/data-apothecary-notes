## Effects

$Y^{a=1}, Y^{a=0}$ are the **potential outcomes** under treatment 1 and 0. They are random variables. Treatment A has causal effect if $Y^{a=1} \neq Y^{a=0}$.

For individual $i$, $Y_i^{a=1}, Y_i^{a=0}$ are deterministic. 

In reality we *do not* observe both potential outcomes for an individual, since we only have ONE outcome. We observe $Y$ and $A$. For a population, average treatment effect (ATE) can be estimate




### Estimands

Greifer, N., & Stuart, E. A. (2021). Choosing the estimand when matching or weighting in observational studies. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.10577.

ATE: average treatment effect in the population

$E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$

ATT: average treatment effect among the treated

$E[Y(1) - Y(0) | Z = 1]$

ATC: average treatment effect among the controls

$E[Y(1) - Y(0) | Z = 0]$

ATM: average treatment effect among the matched


Most of the time we care about ATE and ATT. Pay attention to the matching and weight methods:

* ATE commonly uses IPW (inverse probability weighting)
* ATT uses PSM (propensity score matching).


## Bias

| Data generation | Correct causal model | Correct causal effect |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
|      Collider   |    Y ~ X        |        1           |
|      Confounder |    Y ~ X; Z     |        0.5         |
|      Mediator   |   Direct effect: Y ~ X; Z. Total effect: Y ~ X     |  Direct: 0; total: 1  |
|      M-Bias     |    Y ~ X        |        1           |




### Selection bias

This bias is the result of selecting a common effect of 2 other variables (collider): a treatment, an outcome.

* non-response, missing data
* self-selection, volunteer bias
* selection affected by treatment before study started

A form of **lack of exchangeability** between the treated and untreated.

Correct for selection bias: IP weighting



## ICE (in clinical trial)

Key question: how to present the data visually?

What are considered as important, what are not?


ITT (intention to treat): include the data after rescue medicine. Includes dropouts

PP (Per-protocol): exclude patients taking rescue medicine, only analyse the complete cases

Trial estimands: trial treatment effect depends on how events occur after treatment initiation.

Treatment effect for a given outcome.

Five core attributes

* population
* treatment conditions
* endpoint
* summary measure
* strategies to handle each type of intercurrent event

### Intercurrent event

Post-baseline events (post randomisation in RCT) that affects the interpretation of outcome.

Two categories: 

* treatment-modifying events, affects the receipt of assigned treatment. E.g. early discontinuation, use of rescue, wrong dose, wrong type (placebo for example).

* truncating events, e.g. death, amputation of limb when the limb is relevant for the research question.

Strategies (multiple can be used for different ICE in the same study)

* treatment policy strategy: treat as it is, ignore ICE
* composite strategy: modifies the endpoint value, defined by the investigator
* while-on-treatment (while alive): before intercurrent event data is used.
* hypothetical strategy
* principal stratum strategy: redefine the population
