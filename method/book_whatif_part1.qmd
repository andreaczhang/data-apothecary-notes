> Objective for reading the first 10 chapters: build an overview of the concepts at a high level, so that details can fit in the big picture more easily.


## Chapter 1 - 3

(Notes are written on paper)

Keywords:

- exchangeability, conditional exchangeability
- marginally randomized experiment, conditional and unconditional randomization
- the equivalence of causal risk difference (or ratio) to associational risk difference
- effect, and difference between standardization and IP weighting


## Chapter 4 Effect Modification 

A null average causal effect in the population <u>does not</u> imply a null average causal effect in a particular **subset** of the population, such as males and females. 

Effect modifier: V is a modifier of the effect of A on Y, when the average causal effect on A on Y varies across levels of V.

**Stratification** is the natural way to identify effect modification. Effect modification is also called **effect heterogeneity** across strata of V.

Why care about it? If V modifies the effect of A on Y, then the average effect will differ between populations with different prevalence of V, e.g. the effect (size and direction) is more pronounced in the larger group. Also, it helps to identify the group that would benefit the most from an intervention.

When counterfactual outcomes $Y^{a=1}, Y^{a=0}$ are unavailable, only observed outcomes are available: the use of stratification to detect effect modification will depend on the study design.

* in an ideal marginally randomized experiment with unconditional randomization, the causal RD is the associational RD. Simply carry out a stratified analysis. 

#### Summary

* **IP weighting** and **standardisation** can be used to compute either marginal or conditional effects;
* **stratification** / restriction and **matching** can only be used to compute conditional effects in certain subsets of the population.

All four approaches require exchangeability and positivity.

When there is no effect modification, the effect measures (RR, RD) computed via these four approches will be equal.
