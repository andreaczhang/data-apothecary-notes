Hello, welcome!

This is the note repository for **modern data science skills with a focus on real-world data (observational studies) and clinical trials**. 

Content will be gradually added while I learn the topics, and mostly for personal use. Therefore, it is <u>by no means</u> a complete guide by the time you read it!

I try to organize the content in a modular way: these should cover the important aspects in which a data scientist / modern statistician should know.

* study design
* inference
* models
* programming

Any feedback / mistake corrections are welcome, you can find me [here](https://andreaczhang.github.io). Thank you!
