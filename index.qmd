Hello, welcome!

This is the note repository for **modern data science skills with a focus on drug development and clinical trials**. Content will be gradually added while I learn the topics. Therefore, it is *by no means* a complete guide by the time you read it!

I try to organize the content in a modular way. I think these should cover the important aspects in which a data scientist / modern statistician should know.

* study design
* inference
* models
* reporting
* programming

Any feedback / mistake corrections are welcome, you can find me [here](https://andreaczhang.github.io). Thank you!
