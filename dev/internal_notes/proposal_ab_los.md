Investigate **antibiotics** effect on **length of hospital stay**

All AB combined together



# Analysis + Simulation

### Without causal (can use `liggetid` data to develop)

- survival curve comparison
- cox model adjusting age, sex
- mixed model, with department as levels
- missing data imputation

### Causal

- PS matching
- PS weighting

compare different techniques impact on the estimates

sensitivity analysis
