# Study design

In phase 2, difference in design (sample size) for single arm and randomizedf

 
### Benefit of randomization

Unbiased assignment of treatment. Break the link between prognosis and prescription (allocation). Application of statistical methods based on random sampling

E.g. avoid giving the same treatment to group A that have significantly worse health condition


### Pros and cons of RCT

### Difference in results in OBS (observational study) and RCT

Might not observe an effect in RCT, but effect in OBS studies

- possible no effect in RCT: trial too short to see effect; late stage of disease among candidates to see any improvements of treatment; different treatment in OBS and RCT; comparing initiators vs non-initiators (hence shorter trial period)
- possible effect in OBS: residual confounding: social and environmental exposures; some already using treatment before enrolment
- sampling bias, in OBS the asymptomatic subjects might be missed (or under reported) while in RCT you can count every subject
- survival bias: survived long enough to be enrolled in OBS, and those dead are not; hence boosting effect to prolong survival


### Superiority, equivalence and non-inferiority trials

Non-inferiority trials adopt one-sided test

Equivalence: if the alternative is simpler, cheaper or have fewer side effects. Aim is to determine if difference is between +- delta

### Multilevel, longitudinal design 

Why would these type of design reduce type 1 error rate by accounting for correlation?


# Inference

subgroup analysis, ad hoc, post hoc status

## Survival analysis

Can you analyse duration data with t-test? Why not?
