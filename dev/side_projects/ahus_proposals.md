Target journal: BMJ quality and safety https://qualitysafety.bmj.com

### Initial analysis

AB skjema + Mv processer

Col E-H (doctor hypothesis)

So far keep all types, produce wide format data with time stamps

Merge AB categories

Location, time of the day

pay attention to 

- type
- time consistency
- actual use (compare with process table time stamps)
- first Tx for infection







# Keywords (Paper 2)

joint model

causal inference (estimand framework)

mixed model
