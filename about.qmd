Hello, welcome! 

This is the note repository for some documentation and demonstration on modern data science skills related to drug development. 

I created this repo so that I can find **notes with code and rendered results** easily. Therefore, the target audience is the future-me; if it helps you in some way as well, I'd be more than happy! 

If you see some errors or have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out.
