<p>Case 1: teaching sensitivity, specificity to clinicians</p>
<ul>
<li>S: part of the statistics course, audience are not very familiar with math and probability</li>
<li>T: this topic requires linking sens, spec with prevalence to show that rare disease screening with diagnostic tests have many false positives</li>
<li>A: instead of looking at the formulae, use visual aids, draw some squares with different color to indicate the change of prevalence, and how a large proportion of positives indicated by a very sensitive test are actually false positives</li>
<li>R: students appreciate the visual aids, positive feedback, and good test results</li>
