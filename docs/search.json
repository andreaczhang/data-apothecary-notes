Often not controlled\nPhase 2: 30-100, efficacy, safety and side effects,\nPhase 3: 100+, often randomized\nPhase 4: demonstration\n\nTypes of design\nPopulation have the disease outcome of interest; not healthy voluteers vs diseased.\nRandomisation unit: persons, two eyes of a person, or groups of persons\nComparison structure: parallel, crossover, group allocation\n\nParallel: simultaneous treatment and control groups, subjects randomly assigned to one group.\nCrossover: randomize of order in which treatments are received; TC or CT. Each patient is his/her own control. Washout period: time between two treatments.\n\nVariability reduced because less variability within patient than between patients. Fewer patients needed.\nDisadvantages: only certain treatments can use crossover design, treatment can’t have permanent effects. Carry-over effects from first period; washout needs to be long enough. Dropouts more significant, analysis may be more difficult: correlated outcomes.\nConstant intensity of underlying disease: chronic diseases (e.g. asthma, hypertension, arthritis) + short-term treatment effects (relief of signs or symptoms)\ne.g. morning dose vs evening dose\n\nGroup allocation: a group of subjects (community, school, clinic).\n\nExtensions of the parallel design: factorial, large simple\n\nFactorial: two interventions tested simultaneously. Can be presented in a 2 by 2 table (treatment A +-, treatment B +-); or 3 by 2 etc.\n\nInterested in main effect (if no interaction expected). A vs no A; B vs no B. The other treatment doesn’t matter.\n\nLarge simple: large number of patients, possibly from many study sites.\n\n\nTests other than superiority\n\nEquivalency: intervention response is close to control group response\nNon-inferiority: Treatment A (new) is at least as good as B (established). One-sided test, if A is worse than B, one can be rejected. Does not require as big sample size.\n\n\n\nAdaptive design\nPossible adaptations\n\nrandomization probabilities\nsample size (e.g. group sequential methods)\nvisit schedule: shorten/lengthen follow-up time, change number of timing of visits, treatments (dose/duration, concomitant meds)\nhypothesis tested"

Each patient is his/her own control. Washout period: time between two treatments.\n\nVariability reduced because less variability within patient than between patients. Fewer patients needed.\nDisadvantages: only certain treatments can use crossover design, treatment can’t have permanent effects. Carry-over effects from first period; washout needs to be long enough. Dropouts more significant, analysis may be more difficult: correlated outcomes.\nConstant intensity of underlying disease: chronic diseases (e.g. asthma, hypertension, arthritis) + short-term treatment effects (relief of signs or symptoms)\ne.g. morning dose vs evening dose\n\nGroup allocation: a group of subjects (community, school, clinic).\n\nExtensions of the parallel design: factorial, large simple\n\nFactorial: two interventions tested simultaneously. Can be presented in a 2 by 2 table (treatment A +-, treatment B +-); or 3 by 2 etc.\n\nInterested in main effect (if no interaction expected). A vs no A; B vs no B. The other treatment doesn’t matter.\n\nLarge simple: large number of patients, possibly from many study sites.\n\n\nTests other than superiority\n\nEquivalency: intervention response is close to control group response\nNon-inferiority: Treatment A (new) is at least as good as B (established). One-sided test, if A is worse than B, one can be rejected.

Does not tell difference across different subgroups\nTest for interaction: use of main effect and interaction.\nIssue of multiple testing when doing a series of analyses\n\ninflate sample size to plan for subgroup analysis\nreport number of subgroup analyses performed\npossibly adjust for multiple comparisons\nreport CI instead of just p-values"
