Terminology

* table in the database: as the name suggests
* **fields**: column names, such as `id`
* **key**: the column to match different tables



### Sorting `ORDER BY`

By default, in ascending order (smallest to largest). Or else, use `DESC` or `ASC` to clarify.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY age DESC
```

Text are ordered in alphabetical.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM books
ORDER BY title ASC -- alphabetical 
```


### Limiting data `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`

`LIMIT` Only returns a few. Used in the end.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 3
```

`OFFSET` parameter is used with `LIMIT` to **skip** a number of records

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2 -- returns the 3, 4, 5th record
```




### Putting together 

```sql
-- this is a comment

SELECT 
  employee_id,
  last_name,
  first_name,
  salary,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as ranking
FROM employee
ORDER BY ranking

/* if i have more 
comments */
```
