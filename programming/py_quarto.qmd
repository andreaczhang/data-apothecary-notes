### Pre-requisite 

* Need to enter the virtual environment of your choosing. In RStudio, select the one you need inside Tools -> Global Options -> Python -> Interpreter -> Virtual Environment
* Need `PyYaml` installed in this virtual environment. Try to run `pip install pyyaml` inside the virtualenv.
* Need to set the engine as such, 

```yaml
---
title: "test python"
format: html
jupyter: python3
---
```


Afterwards, can try to render 

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```


To check what packages are installed, can use `pip list`.
