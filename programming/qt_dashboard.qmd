The way to deploy the dashboard website is exactly the same as a normal quarto website.


- `_quarto.yml`, do not need to change anything. The project can be kept as a **website**!
- `index.yml`, change the format to `dashboard`.

It is possible to add a few pages, just like a normal quarto website.
