## Summary on one table

* get to know what variables (columns) are available in the table -> print first n rows (potential 1)
* number of rows with `COUNT(*)`, combined with conditions


```sql
-- prints first row
SELECT * FROM data LIMIT 1 

-- prints nrow
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data 

-- number of the first names that start with "C"
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data WHERE first_name LIKE "C%" 
```

subsetting with `IN` syntax

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients 
WHERE patient_id IN (1, 45, 534, 879, 1000)
```

grouping by ID, then count records per ID (no need to compile the inner data first)

```sql
SELECT
  patient_id,
  COUNT(*) AS total_admissions
FROM admissions
WHERE patient_id = 579;
```

### Data quality

check missing (NULL)





### Numerial column

* range of values, with `max` and `min`
* combine with values derived from inside the table, say the maximum of a column

```sql
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  height
FROM patients
WHERE height = (
    SELECT max(height)
    FROM patients
  )
```



### Date

select year that starts from a certain value, like 2020

```sql
SELECT count(*) 
FROM patients 
WHERE birth_date like "2010%"

-- the following should also work
-- WHERE YEAR(birth_date) = '2010'
-- WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR from birth_date) = '2010'
-- WHERE substring(birth_date, 4) = '2010'
```


### Text

* unique categories
* get the number of unique values
  * select count directly
  * `WITH` clause

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT xvar FROM data

-- solution 1
SELECT COUNT(allergies) FROM (select distinct allergies
FROM patients
WHERE allergies IS NOT NULL)

-- solution 2
WITH alls AS (select distinct allergies
FROM patients
WHERE allergies IS NOT NULL) 

WHERE COUNT(allergies) FROM alls
```

## Multiple tables: JOIN 

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, province_name 
FROM patients LEFT JOIN province_names
ON patients.province_id = province_names.province_id
```
