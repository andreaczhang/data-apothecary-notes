Pay attention to how the path is specified: 

```
 /_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd 
```

```{webr}
#| edit: false
#| output: false
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins_clean <- penguins |> drop_na()
```

Choose a species of penguin, we'll work with that species for the rest of the tutorial.

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
viewof input_species = Inputs.select(["Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo"])
penguin_info = {
  const description = {
    Adelie: md`The **Adelie** is the most widespread penguin species, and, along with the emperor penguin, is the most southerly distributed of all penguins.`,
    Chinstrap: md`The **chinstrap** penguin's name stems from the narrow black band under its head, which makes it appear as if it were wearing a black helmet, making it easy to identify.`,
    Gentoo: md`The **gentoo** penguin calls in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting, which the bird emits with its head thrown back.`,
  }
  return description[input_species]
}
```

```{webr}
#| edit: false
#| echo: false
#| input:
#|  - input_species
penguins_alpha <- penguins |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(alpha = ifelse(species == input_species, 0.8, 0.2))

p <- ggplot(data = penguins_alpha, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = species, shape = species, alpha = alpha),
    size = 3
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  scale_alpha(guide = 'none') +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species",
       alpha = "Penguin species")

ggplotly(p)
