{{< include /_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd >}}

Pay attention to how the path is specified: 

```
 /_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd 
```

```{webr}
for (x in 1:5) {
  print(x ** 2)
}
```


Is it possible to make it inside a dashboard? probably not. it would require specifying the `format: live-html`
