MMRM has one distinct feature compared to other linear mixed models: subject-specific random effects are considered as residual effects (part of error correlation matrix).

### Methodology 

Basic linear mixed-effects model for a single level of grouping

$$
y_i = X_i \beta + Z_i b_i + \epsilon_i, i = 1, ..., n
$$
$$
b_i \sim N(0, \Psi), \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2 I)
$$

* $\beta$ is p-dim vector of fixed effects
* $b$ is q-dim vecor of random patient specific effects
* $X_i$ of size $n_i \times p$ and $Z_i$ of size $n_i \times q$ are regressor matrices relating observations to the fixed effects and random effects.
* $\epsilon_i$ is $n_i$-dimensional within-subject error
