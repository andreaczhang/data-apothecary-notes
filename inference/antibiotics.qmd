## Economics and production

Drug-resistant diseases kill 700k people (Plackett2020) yearly, however fewer new antibiotic drugs are reaching the market.

Development cost: 1.5 billion USD (for one drug, based on 2017 study) while revenue is 45 million USD.

* not enough demand: physicians prescribe less, treatment cycle is short compared to chronic diseases
* price is low
* development is difficult
