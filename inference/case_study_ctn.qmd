Task overview see [here](https://rconsortium.github.io/RMedicine_website/Competition.html)

* factors that may contribute to treatment success or failure
* drop-out, relapse
* treatments: MOUD - methadone, buprenorphine, extended-release depot naltrexone

Questions of interest (examples)

* Which demographic characteristics are most associated with drop-out / relapse rates?
* Are there any drugs/substances more associated with higher or lower drop-out / relapse rates?

Article describing the process: [Odom 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10490938/)




### Background information

SUD: substance use disorders; UDS: urine drug screening

Multiple categories for UDS variable

* `+`: positive for substance
* `-`: negative for substance
* `o`: no sample
* `*`: inconclusive or mixed results
* `_`: no specimeen required per study design (weekend, holidays, pre-randomization)

TLFB: time-line followback: patient self-report with a standard schema

Interpret: `+++++---+-----------o-`

* Positive at baseline (+)
* challenging first month (++++)
* second month only one relapse (---+)
* remained abstinent from opioids for the reminder of the trial, with one single missing (o-)



```{r}
library(CTNote)
usePattern_char <- "__++++*o-------+--+-o-o-o+o+oooooo"
measure_retention(usePattern_char)
```





## CTN data


### Study protocol

Three studies 

* [CTN 30](https://ctnlibrary.org/protocol/ctn0030/)([Protocol](https://ctnlibrary.org/protocols/0030.pdf)): prescription opiate abuse treatment study. Randomized, outpatient study, whether adding additional drug counseling improves outcome. Two phases. 
  * Tx0: **Bup/Nx** (buprenorphine/naloxone) + SMM (standard medical management)
  * Tx1: **Bup/Nx + EMM** (enhanced medical management)
  * phase 1 n=653, phase 2 n=360
  * primary finding: patients are likely to reduce opioid use during Bup/Nx treatment, however unsuccessful outcome is highly likely even after 12 weeks if tapering off treatment.
* [CTN 27](https://ctnlibrary.org/protocol/ctn0027/)([Protocol](https://ctnlibrary.org/protocols/0027.pdf), [Saxon 2013](https://ctnlibrary.org/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?BU=http%3A//ctndisseminationlibrary.org/ctnsearch.htm&QY=find%20AutoNumber%20/%20Status%20ct%20%28%28901%29%26finished%29&TN=ctnlibrary&DF=Full&RF=Full&AC=QBE_QUERY&CS=0&MF=searchbutton.ini)): **Bup/Nx vs MET (methadone)** on liver function. Randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase 4 study.
* [CTN 51](https://ctnlibrary.org/protocol/ctn0051/) ([Lee 2018](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/abstract)): **Bup/Nx vs XR-NTX** naltrexone, effectiveness of pharmacotheerapeutic aids to recovery who completed detoxification and achieved short term abstinence. n=570
  * XR-NTX (n=283): induction hurdle, higher rate of 24-week relapse, fewer successfully initiated XR-NTX (204 of 283) than Bup/Nx (270 of 287)
  * for those inducted successfully, relapse rate is similar
  * relapse: 4 consecutive weeks of any non-study opioid use (UDS or report), or 7 consecutive days of self-reported use.
  
  
*If want to know which subject belongs to which study, use `CreateProtocolHistory()` or `everybody` data to have project ID*.  
 
Opioids: Oxymorphone, Opium, Fentanyl, Hydromorphone, Codeine, Suboxone, Tramadol, Morphine, Buprenorphine, Hydrocodone, Opioid, Methadone, Oxycodone, Heroin



### Times

* day 0: consent signed
* day of randomization (dr)
* day of receiving first dose of study drug (dd)
* induction delay: dr - dd (in terms of days, not weeks)
* any day before dd is **pre-treatment**, even if participants are assigned to a treatment arm
  * pre-tx (baseline) / treatment period is defined by the first non-zero dose for the patient. 


### Endpoints (CTNote)

As of CTNote, there are three types of outcomes

* [abstinence](https://ctn-0094.github.io/CTNote/articles/library_abstinence_20220711.html#ctn-0094-abstinence)
* [use reduction](https://ctn-0094.github.io/CTNote/articles/library_reduction_20220630.html)
* [relapse](https://ctn-0094.github.io/CTNote/articles/library_relapse_20220711.html)

**Weekly pattern data**. Week 1 starts the day after randomisation or signed consent, depending whether patients are randomized or not. Negative time stamps suggest prior randomization (or consent).

```{r}
pattern_o <- public.ctn0094extra::derived_weeklyOpioidPattern

Outcomes (relapse)

```{r}
