## Motivation

What do I wish to get out of this analysis

* a new dataset that is complex enough to test out methodology, potentially causal inference, since this is a RCT dataset
* learn more about the novel ways to present data
* try out AI for generating ideas
* write about it in at least 2 blogposts

My practical aim is to do **ONE analysis only**, and **present the result** in an innovative way. 

### Angle

**Visualization** would be my priority, and presenting non-standard data is a key. This suggests that adding **interactivity** would be relevant here.

Limited relevant knowledge means that my analysis wouldn't standout.


## Plan

The deadline for completion is 2024.5.1, however I can only spare 7 full days to work on it. 

#### Research stage: narrow down the scope

Outcome: abstinence, use reduction, relapse




Risk factors 




#### Analysis stage: do one analysis

 


#### Visualization: interactivity

Possibly not standard visualization (KM plot)



## Log 

* 3.25 Initialize project, understand symbolic drug use data
* 3.26 Read through vignette for the data derivation. Read data description for 3 data sources, try to understand the data generating process.
