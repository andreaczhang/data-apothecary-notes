G-computation 

* Fit a model for `y ~ x + z`, where z is all covariates
* Create a duplicate for each level of x
* Set the value of x to a single value for each cloned dataset: `x = 1` for one, `x = 0` for the other
* predict
* calculate estimate, `mean(x_1) - mean(x_0)`

Advantages

* flexible
* precise (compared to propensity-score based methods)
* basis of other important models (e.g. TMLE)
