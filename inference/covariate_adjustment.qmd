Baseline covariates are variables measured prior to randomization, expected to have strong association with outcome. Potential confounding occurs when the distribution of baseline covariates between treatment groups are imbalanced. 

To address confounding: 

* design stage: stratified randomization to reduce imbalance
* analysis stage: covariate adjustment

Benefits:

* reduce sample size 
* improve precision - smaller CI, higher power
* some CA do not depend on a correctly specified model

Recent FDA guidance requires distinction between **conditional and marginal** treatment effects. These two coincide in linear models, but not in non-linear models (e.g. binary, ordinal, count, time-to-event outcomes).
