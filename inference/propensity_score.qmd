Propensity score

(Rosenbaum and Rubin)

* in observational studies, conditioning on propensity scores can lead to unbiased estimates of the exposure effect
* given that there are no unmeasured confounders
* every subject has a non-zero probability of receiving exposure

Fit a logistic regression: 

* binary outcome: exposure (1,0)
* covariates: all but exposure

Predict the values (probability), they are the propensity scores


### Matching

ATT, ATC, ATE, ATM

`MatchIt` package

### Weighting

ATE $w_{ATE} = \frac{Z_i}{p_i} + \frac{1-Z_i}{1-p_i}$

ATT $w_{ATT} = \frac{p_i Z_i}{p_i} + \frac{p_i(1-Z_i)}{1-p_i}$

ATC $w_{ATC} = \frac{(1 - p_i) Z_i}{p_i} + \frac{(1 - p_i)(1-Z_i)}{1-p_i}$
